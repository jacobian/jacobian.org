# This can be slow, and changes less frequently than the code. By installing
# deps into this layer, and just copying over the whole virtualenv, we can avoid
# the overhead of installing dependencies again if they don't change.
#
# There's one trick to this: the --no-root option to Poetry. By default, Poetry
# wants to install the source package, which means COPYing src/, which means we
# have to re-install every time anything changes.
